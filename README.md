 `CPR2U` is an education solution to solve Korean's low CPR performance and survival rates for out-of-hostpital cradiac arrest patients. Users can receive CPR education through online and receive their CPR postures feedback through machine learning. In case of cardiac arrest, users can call for nearby certified users who have completed our training course to request emergency CPR.

## ðŸ–Œ Introduction
 In Korea where the aging is fast, the number of patients with sudden cardiac arrest is expected to increase. In those cases, the survival rate could increase 2.4 times higher if CPR is performed by a bystander. However, the actual rate of CPR performed in Korea is only 24.7%. According to a study done by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 94% of people were aware of CPR, but only about 25% of them had actually learned it. Furthermore, among those people, over 53.6% of them have not received any training in the past two years. 
 
 Firstly, we will make it easier for general public to receive CPR education. Since the rate of CPR graduated is declined nearly 80% after the pandemic, we believe the opportunity to learn cpr through online should be expanded to people, rather than through offline. Next, We want to make people take turns as much as they can during CPR in the emergency. CPR is a physically demanding processing that requires 120 compressions per minute. According to the guidelines, it is safe to replace the person compressing every two minutes. Therefore, we want to find people who can do CPR nearby and send them to emergencies.
